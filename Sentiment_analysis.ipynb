It really exceeded my expectations and I had fun during the whole movie. Critics are really being harsh and I can't believe that beauty and the beast was more critically praised. The movie was so bland and boring while this one has so much energy and life to it. The characters had amazing chemistry with each other and the lines were delivered smoothly. The two things I was worried about that subsided as soon as the movie started are: 1- Jafar's character: Marwan tries his best to make but the material he's given isn't strong enough. I wish they developed his character more. However, I didn't mind the change they did it with his character as it fits more with this version. 2- Cultural representation: The trailers made the movie look like a production from bollywood. Not hating on the Indian culture, but it really annoyed me as Arab to see a Middle Eastern/Arabic folk tale that we all know long before Disney introduced it to the world to be represented in a fully different culture. Fortunately, the movie looks and feels way more Arabian such Arabic writings here and there, hearing some people speaking Arabic briefly, the names and appearance of the people of Agrabah and of course the amazing score! Although there are some slight hints of India/South Asia in the clothing and dancing, but I didn't mind that at all.\\n\\nI would've give it a 10 if the cinematography was better.

Where is the story telling that keeps you enticed and pulls you into the movie? Where is the wonder in the cave of wonders? Where is the feeling of flying a magic carpet? Where is the Aladdin we all can relate to and inspires us to be better? Where is the family relationship we can all relate to? NOWHERE....that's the problem; was this movie rushed? Why was the production/direction so bad? Was there not enough budgeting? Were you guys on a deadline?

Will Smith is amusing enough as the Genie now and when the more dramatic scenes come, I was touched enough by the story, characters, and the actors playing them. And those songs are, of course, as awesome as ever! So on that note, I recommend this version of Aladdin.\n",

What's wrong with the critics, bashing the movie for no reason? The movie was beautiful filled with joy, comedy, story, it got everything! Mena Massoud, Naomi scott and Will smith gave their best on this. Guy Ritchie made this movie possible, thanks to him. It's a Disney movie, so there will be more songs(it goes along with the story, you won't get bored). Watch with your family, you'll love it.\n",

Moments of character growth or interaction feel rushed and are changed up from the original, yet the outcome in the story still illogically remains the same. Some of the additional scenes around new characters simply feel laughable and out of place. The additional song written for this film heavily clashes with the musical style of the existing ones and the instrumental accompaniment of the songs in general sounds too modern and not like a classical musical anymore. The humor in this movie is very hit and miss. Some lines and moments are indeed extremely enjoyable, while most others seem too forced. The VFX in this film are not entirely up to task and will undoubtedly look dated in a few years time. Most importantly, the overall spectacle feels much less impactful than the original's. Overall, there would be much more to go into. But this should be enough in summary.\n",

Exuberant, alive, and completely entertaining, the adventure-fantasy combines a raucous sense of humor, iconic performances, and classical songs into a joyful blast of cinematic color. Aladdin is a exhilarating piece of work perfectly brought to life.\n",

The songs seemed slower and not as exciting as they should be in my opinion. The Genie didn't seem as fun of a character because of this. The rest of the movie aspects were good and a level that I expected based on growing up with the original cartoon version.\n",
       "299  Talk about the wrong cast and cheap visual effects. This is a childhood favorite of mine and was really looking forward to seeing it come to the big screen again. If you are into Indian movies and Bollywood I assume you might like it. This isn't an indian folklore people, why would you direct and cast it in such a way? Where is the Aladdin that keeps you on the edge of your seat with excitement? Where is the story telling that keeps you enticed and pulls you into the movie? Where is the wonder in the cave of wonders? Where is the feeling of flying a magic carpet? Where is the Aladdin we all can relate to and inspires us to be better? Where is the family relationship we can all relate to? NOWHERE....that's the problem; was this movie rushed? Why was the production/direction so bad? Was there not enough budgeting? Were you guys on a deadline? WIll Smith is an amazing actor, and as always carried this movie onto the big screen; but he isn't Robin William. I was actually laughing most of the time at the lines. I honestly hope not all disney re-make movies are going to be done with the same standards.\\n\\nYou know how sometimes you hear someone try and retell a joke and they just totally butcher it? Thats what happened here, great story, but terrible story telling. At the end of the day, BAD JOKE!\n",

       "499    talk about the wrong cast and cheap visual effects  this is a childhood favorite of mine and was really looking forward to seeing it come to the big screen again  if you are into indian movies and bollywood i assume you might like it  this isn t an indian folklore people  why would you direct and cast it in such a way  where is the aladdin that keeps you on the edge of your seat with excitement  where is the story telling that keeps you enticed and pulls you into the movie  where is the wonder in the cave of wonders  where is the feeling of flying a magic carpet  where is the aladdin we all can relate to and inspires us to be better  where is the family relationship we can all relate to  nowhere    that s the problem  was this movie rushed  why was the production direction so bad  was there not enough budgeting  were you guys on a deadline  will smith is an amazing actor  and as always carried this movie onto the big screen  but he isn t robin william  i was actually laughing most of the time at the lines  i honestly hope not all disney re make movies are going to be done with the same standards   you know how sometimes you hear someone try and retell a joke and they just totally butcher it  thats what happened here  great story  but terrible story telling  at the end of the day  bad joke \n",
